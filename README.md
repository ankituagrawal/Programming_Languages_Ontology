Programming_Languages_Ontology
==============================

Meta-ontology for three Object oriented programming languages viz. C++, Java and Python. 
Meta-ontology for programming languages is not commonplace, and if created successfully, we can put it to a variety of uses. Currently, mapping similar concepts of different programming languages is a challenge. For example, given a programming task, a programmer needs to compare and select the best and efficient among several programming languages. If a meta-ontology exists, a programmer can simply query it to find the equivalent concepts and constructs in different programming languages and make a decision. Also, a programming language meta-ontology can be integrated into existing tools to detect plagiarism where logic has been copied but developed in different programming languages. Furthermore, meta-ontology can aid in automatic code transformation software to automate the process of converting code from one programming language to other.
